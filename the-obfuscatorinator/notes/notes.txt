For Generic types that use a mystery generic and then get set later, the set type
is not recognized.

For example:
    Test<?> test = new Test<String>("Hi");

the type detected is Test<?> and not Test<String>




Interesting case:

for (int i = 3; i < 6; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                int cccc = 2;
            }
        }

i is detected as "{ i"



if (3 > 2) {
            int aaaa = 3;
        }

        int aaaa = 2;

        5
         int aaaa
        5
         aaaa =



int[] hi = {1,2,3};

int hi
        5
